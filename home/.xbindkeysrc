# The T470 doesn't have media control keys...
# The older Thinkpads used Fn + the arrow keys for those, I have no idea why
# they stopped doing that.
# The keyboard controller doesn't even pass those keypresses through to me,
# so I have to emulate it using Mod4 instead.
# I'm also forcing Spotify to have priority over Quod Libet, since the latter
# is always running in the background anyways.
